# teambuilder

## Description
-This is a dev team builder appplication that runs off of the cli with node js. You enter in information about your team members and cards on the website are made for their respective members that include their provided information!

##Details
-The application includes 4 test suites on the different classes used in the object oriented programming. OOP was used so that you could create as many members as you want. Different memebers required different titles so we we able to use if statments that checked the values unique to the new objects and the titles were created for their respective members.

## What i learned
-I learned a lot about object oriented programming i remember being very confusued in the lesson plan for that and the testing. But now i feel i really understand exactly why to use classes and subclasses. More specifically i was able to take the contents of an object and map it to an array so that i was able to access both key and value pairs and use the index value rather than their specific value due to them changing.
